                          **Moody Gatsby; a deformation of weather patterns**

Although Fitzgerald’s *The Great Gatsby* has been abundantly studied among scholars, the weather patterns have gone unnoticed.  This masterpiece of Fitzgerald embodies a remarkable number of symbols. Schneider in his *Color Symbolism* points to several of them that are represented by colors. He begins with mentioning the already familiar and famous symbol; the green light that symbolizes the organic future and the promise of a dream enchanting Gatsby. Then he brings attention to the color yellow that represents the corruption money plants in the dream. He further elaborates the way the novel’s conflicts have been portrayed by the lights and darks that Fitzgerald uses. Lights as in Gatsby’s dream world that has the vividness of a rainbow and dark is the reader's view of the valley of ashes with the gloomy reality lying underneath (145). Schneider continues to draw connections, between white and gold, blue and white, and white and red; the color white color, Schneider argues, symbolizes purity and innocence (i.e. Jordan and Daisy's white dresses). The yellow on the other hand ultimately taints and corrupts that purity (146). Among all the symbols that he discusses weather conditions are not to be seen; however, it is plausible that the color yellow could be linked to the yellow and golden color of the sun.  If one takes on this analogy, the golden rays of sunshine, contrary to the conventional beliefs, become a symbol for corruption and decay. The symbolic yellow one more time echoes the conception that Gatsby’s yellow car is the cars of death, the grotesque end to the Myrtle`s doomed life (Schneider 149). Symbols are a dominant element ruling the overall theme of *The Great Gatsby* and despite the impressive number of studies, very little attention has been paid to the weather conditions.

Various patterns start to emerge when looking closely into Gatsby. Doyno detects patterns in The Great Gatsby that deepen the characterization by enforcing repetition on dialogue, gesture and details (162). He explains that, for example, the repetition of daisy’s dialogues in the first scene in chapter one and a similar one in chapter seven are applied to emphasize her incapability to grow; in chapter seven Daisy, due to the hotness of weather, says “we can’t move” which is parallel to her saying in chapter one “I am paralyzed with happiness” (161). Doyno is right to observe that these receptions bias the readers toward events and themes since these repetitions shape the reader’s attitude to accept an improbable event (162). However, he fails to notice the effect of the hot weather in Daisy’s resistance to move. This repletion might be emphasizing Daisy’s lack of growth, but it also influences the reader’s perception of the “hot” weather. He also detects the parallel between Myrtle’s train ride, her first meeting with Tom, and Nick’s train ride on a “broiling” day in chapter seven as a representative of Myrtle’s desperate romanticism along with Nick’s uncomfortable realism (163). He, however, does not take into account the possibility that the hotness of the day could be a pattern that implants biased expectations in reader’s mind and possibly affects the plot trajectory.
Parker in *The two versions of the hero* briefly notices the repeated allusions to seasons that are suggestive of change, noticing how in the beginning of the novel Nick has “that familiar conviction that life was beginning with summer “(39). Although Parker’s main focus remains the time and Gatsby and Nick’s perception of time. Eble observes the same significance in *The Great Gatsby* in a more detailed analysis. He parses the novel into its chapters and brushes upon the fact that the novel starts in the summer and Gatsby’s guests all visit during the summer (5). He does not stop there and continues to perceive that Gatsby and Daisy’s meeting is set in the rain, the meeting in which Gatsby is finally able to hold the past and present together. He, interestingly, points out that the mood changes noticeably in chapter seven; the lights in Gatsby’s house do not go on anymore, heat and sweat become the main images and most importantly all the crucial climactic events of the story happen in this long chapter-longest in the book (6). Along with the change of season and mood in chapter seven the prose also quickens (Parker 6). That observation is a strong reason to look closer into the text for it would seem that the intensity of the content is also reflected in the form.

The most direct reference to the weather in The Great Gatsby has been made by Godshalk in *The Great Gatsby and Edward Thomas's `Rain'*. He briefly touches upon the subject of the importance of weather in the novel by noting that Fitzgerald borrows “blessed are the dead that rain falls on” from Edward Thomas’s poem “Rain”. However he mentions that the sentence in Thomas’s poem is “Blessed are the dead that rain rains upon”  and he puts forward four possibilities as to why Fitzgerald would make this alteration; for sentence fluency, to demonstrate once more the unreliability of the narrator, portray memory slip in characters, and that he simply misremembered (77). The closest implication that Godshalk gives about the connection between the poem and the novel is simply a prevailing shared theme; the dim and gloomy picture of death (76). His study once more leaves the degree to which the weather conditions impact the story unmeasured.
The weather in The Great Gatsby seems to have a strong link to emotional state of the characters and consequently affecting their course of action. This paper takes a closer look at how different weather conditions impact the characters’ emotions and raises the question that should the weather conditions alter, would those emotions also be modified to changing the plot. Primarily this study is considered with attempting to extract new meanings from the text by deforming it. Deformance turns away from the conventional notion that the text must be studied in its original form. For Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann in *Deformance and Interpretation*, using deformed poetry as examples, demonstrate how the meaning of a poem –or any text- can be exposed by deforming the original text. They argue that since meaning is a dynamic exchange it is best revealed as a play of differences (31). Deformance can take various forms: reordering, isolating, altering and adding. Altering the text, as Hoover puts it, “is one of the best ways to understand how a texts works” (Samuels and McGann 470). In other words, the most minor changes to the text can impact the implications of it tremendously. Modifying the text would lead one to discover underlying function of the text since “the poem's intelligibility is not a function of the interpretation, but that all interpretation is a function of the poem's system intelligibility” (Samuels and McGann 40). This study attempts to reveal the way deforming the text would change the function of the novel. Deformance will assist in opening the underlying meanings that the use of particular weather conditions in the novel contain, for there is the suspension of an existing association between the weather patterns and the way the text of *The Great Gatsby* functions. Deformance would expose the role that the weather patterns play in the novel by extracting these patterns and applying the alteration method to deform the text. This deformance would help one to discover and unveil the way the weather patterns function and the purpose they serve in the original text. The deformed patterns will help readers detect the way the original ones affect the form and function of the text.  

In order to determine which parts of the text to deform the words associated with weather were detected through close reading of the novel.  This process was not taken place by a computer since there are many metaphorical uses of weather-related words in the novel that a computer would not be able to differentiate. Hence, all the words literally indicating the weather condition in the novel were extracted. To make the analysis and distinction easier, the novel was parsed into nine parts which were the same nine chapters of the book. Making use of a spreadsheet, the words related to weather were categorized under each chapter in an attempt to discover the parts of the text that would revoke new meanings if deformed. Various incidents in which weather indicators were used surfaced showing similarity to Eble’s assumption that the weather conditions and seasons change as the mood of the story changes (5). One of the first instances catching the attention is Nick’s very first visit to the Buchanan’s’ house which happens on a “warm windy afternoon” (Fitzgerald 9). Further into the story Nick meets Myrtle for the first time on a warm day (Fitzgerald 31). He also makes a quick trip to New York with Gatsby on a hot July day where they run into Tom, a scene full of tension (Fitzgerald 79).  One of the most important incidents is in chapter five where Gatsby and Daisy meet after five years. Although it is raining all throughout the incident this chapter is emotionally the most positive one. As mentioned previously chapter seven is embedded with twists and climaxes and looking into the weather patterns reveals that it is also heavy with references to heat, even described as the hottest day of the summer (Fitzgerald 121). The constant repetition of the heat in chapter seven and the rain in chapter five must have been used to emphasize a hidden meaning following Doyno’s thought that Fitzgerald tends to use repetition of particular patterns to deepen characterization and highlight certain elements of the novel (161).

Determination of the way the particular parts of the text containing weather-related references function in relation to the sentimental state of the story was conducted by analyzing the emotional valence of the plot. In addition, the repetition of words stemmed from “rain” and “heat” were calculated. The latter was calculated with python to see how many times a certain word was repeated. In chapter five the word “rain” is repeated 17 times which is 28.81% of the total times it was repeated in the whole novel. In chapter seven the word heat is repeated 9 times - almost half as much as it was repeated in the whole novel (47.36%)- and the word “hot” was repeated ten times which is 26.31% of the total use in the novel. There seemed to be a palpable potential that weather conditions had a major influence on the emotional valence of the novel. Therefore to further elaborate on the relationship between the sentiments and the weather conditions an emotional analysis was ran through the text using Matthew Jockers’ “Syuzhet” Package.  

Matthew Jockers, inspired by Vonnegut, expands on the idea that computers might be able to determine the shape of the plot of a story and draws a sentimental analysis of *Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* based on an analysis of the sentiment markers in the text. Jockers, in his 2014 blog post “Plot Arcs (Schmidt Style)”, notes that:” the process involves two major components: a controlled vocabulary of positive and negative sentiment markers collected by Bing Liu of the University of Illinois at Chicago and a machine model that I trained to identify and score passages as positive or negative.” Using his “syuzhet” package-a tool for tracking relative shifts in narrative sentiment- the linear sentimental progression was analyzed. This package, as Jockers elaborates in his blog, “looks into the structure of narrative by means of sentimental analysis and reveals emotional and effectual shifts that cause the narrative movement between conflict and conflict resolution”. This was conducted on *The Great Gatbsy* to see how the emotional state of the text was where it portrayed rainy or hot weather conditions.
This package starts analyzing the text by parsing the novel into sentences and after collecting the sentences sends them into a function that assesses the sentiment of each sentence. These data are plotted into a graph that would make the interpretation of a text easier. In this graph the x-axis represents the passage of time from the beginning to the end of the text, and the y-axis measures the degrees of positive and negative sentiment.[1]

![Fig.1 Transformed values of *The Great Gatsby*](transformed.png) [2]

In the chart below, as Jockers calls it in his “The Rest of the Story” blog post is a classic “man on hill”. The plot begins with a fairly negative tone, goes through a highly positive phase and ends at the bottom of the hill with a sad ending. It is clearly interpreted, with a familiarity with the plot, that during the rainy days of chapter five the sentimental state of the text is highly positive and in the hot chapter seven it is greatly negative.   
There seems to be an underlying purpose for employing these particular weather patterns since these associations with the weather and emotional state of the novel is not in line with either Godshalk’s interpretation- that the rain in *The great Gatsby* is linked with lost love and death (76). Neither it is scientific for it has been proved through several case studies that there seems to be no direct association with the weather condition and the emotional state of the individuals- despite the common belief that sunlight has promotes positive emotions and rain renders one sad (Denissen 667). To dig deeper into the text and reveal in what way Fitzgerald has mapped the function of these weather conditions to emphasize a certain element in the course of the novel it deformance was applied to the original text. This method as Samuels and McGann noted would revoke the true function of the text and help to illustrate the intention behind Fitzgerald's choice of certain weather conditions.

The part of the novel chosen for deformance was chapter seven since as Eble observes is the longest one in the novel and filled with twists and climaxes (6). It has, also, made obvious by the results of the emotional analysis that this chapter is heated with tension and negative sentiment. The primary concern was to examine the function of the concept heat has on the content of the novel. Therefore, the repetition and especially the abundant references to heat in chapter seven were focused on. Using a simple text editor the words “broiling”, “hot”, “warm”, “heat” and all the stemmed words were replaced by words with an opposite connotation. This application aimed to experiment with the change that these alterations would make in the function of the text. Once these alterations were implemented manually while going through the text the modification that they consequently made in the course of the plot were evaluated. Here is an example of the deformed text in chapter seven, seemingly the most significant chapter of the novel. The scene starts with Nick’s visit to Tom Buchanan’s house with Gaby’s company; this scene paves the way to the ultimate death of three characters. The description of that day, as Nick puts it, is of a hot and sweltering day “The next day was broiling, almost the last, certainly the warmest, of the summer” (Fitzgerald 121). He enters the Buchanans’ house and finds Daisy and Jordan resting on the couch in the comfort of the cooling fans (Fitzgerald 122). To be able to stand the heat Daisy asks Tom to make them a cold drink (Fitzgerald 123). However, replacing the weather patterns in this passage would alter the course that the plot moves on to their decision to make a trip to the city. Below are fragments of the deformed text:


									The next day was cool, almost the last, certainly the coldest, of the winter.
									The room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and
									Jordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols, weighing down
									their own white dresses against the sizzling of the fireplace. "We can't move," they said together.
									"Make us a hot cup of tea," cried Daisy.
									Tom came back, preceding four cups of tea that steam rose from in the cold.
									Gatsby took up his tea.
									"They certainly look hot," he said, with visible tension.
									They drank in long greedy swallows. Sitting on the big couch, they sipped the warm tea and relaxed 
									in the comfort that the cold lurking outside is trapped in the wind.


Through this deformation and replacing the heat of the summer with the cold of the winter an alteration in the character’s course of action occurs that terminates their decision to drive to the town altogether. Consequently, the accident that takes place on the drive back killing Myrtle does not occur. Changing the weather pattern as we go on in the story still has an enormous impact on the plot. Later in the chapter while trying to decide how to go to town Gatsby’s leather car seats has been heated by the warmth of the aggressive summer sun and therefore Tom suggest that they exchange their cars (Fitzgerald 128). Eliminating the heat of the summer would take the possibility of Tom driving Gatsby's car to New York off the table. The car didn't have much gas in, so it obliged Tom to make a stop by Wilson’s garage. Had Wilson haven't seen Tom driving the yellow car, he would not have any means of finding out who the car belongs to and would not narrow down the suspect of Myrtle’s murder to Gatsby. But even prior to that, Myrtle wouldn't run to the yellow car if she wasn’t under the impression that the car belonged to Tom. Furthermore Tom not stopping by Wilson’s garage would have saved him the information about Wilson and Myrtle's moving away, would not lash out at Gatsby and revealing his dishonesty to Daisy. This shock drove Daisy to an unstable emotional state that affected her driving and compromised her driving.
 
Through the deformance of the text is becomes clear that the heat in the text ultimately results in the death of three characters. It can be argued that heat is a symbol than enforces the implication of doomed fate on the characters through repetition. The use of this symbol starts in the early chapters; when nick visits Tom and Daisy for the first time (5) , Nick meeting Myrtle, Nick and Gatsby’s trip to town(68) and most importantly the story beginning in the summer. This repetition of the heat like any other repetitions in the text serves a purpose (Doyno 161). The reader’s judgment gets tainted by the repeated use of certain weather, conditioning their interpretation and intuition towards the existing weather conditions.
   
Deforming the text helps one to clearly distinguish the role of weather conditions in the novel that previous scholars have barely touched upon. Without deforming the text the function of the weather related patterns would not be grasped and the way that they manipulate the form of the text would not be visible in the original text. This is the case of many scholars who have stumbled upon the noticeability of weather conditions and seasons in the novel yet have not assumed a greater influence that they play on the course of the text. Deformation makes us aware of the symbols that Fitzgerald employs by the intricate patterns of weather that he uses throughout the text. Among the weather conditions referred to “rain” in chapter five is one of the important instances. It has an implication of peace and positive emotional valence, drizzling in the background while Gatsby and Daisy meet for the first time after five years. As mentioned previously in the pouring rain Gatsby has been able to hold the past and future together. The cool weather seems to be linked directly to peace and tranquility along with an overly positive emotional valence in the novel. Daisy and Gatsby’s first kiss was on an autumn night (Fitzgerald 119). When Daisy is restless because of the heat Jordan tries to cheer her up by the promise of a better state of life that comes with the crisp of the fall (Fitzgerald 126). Nick goes back home in winter and the story-as well as the emotional valence of the plot- finally gains some positivity and stability. And most importantly Gatsby is blessed after his death because rain falls on him (Fitzgerald 186).
	
The use of rain by both Fitzgerald and Edward Thomas tickles the curious suspension that there might be more into the choice of reciting this sentence other than merely an inspiration by the dark imagery in Thomas’ poem (Godshalk 76). There must have been a trigger in the sentence that strikes Fitzgerald. Dilworth explores the possibility of identification of Gatsby with Christ and argues that as an idealizing romantic Gatsby is an evocation of Jesus explaining that Gatsby’s self-invention and refusal to accept his biological parents established him as a son of God (120). It can be claimed that Fitzgerald is using the same religious device in applying the weather patterns in the text since several instances from the bible demonstrate how in Christianity rain is considered a “bliss” from god while the scorching sun would be the ultimate punishment for sinners:

"For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits" (English standard Bible, James 1:11)

"They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore; the sun shall not strike them, nor any scorching heat. Revelation" (English standard Bible, 7:16)

"Then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit"  (English standard Bible, Leviticus 26:4)

Ask rain from the Lord in the season of the spring rain, from the Lord who makes the storm clouds, and he will give them showers of rain, to everyone the vegetation in the field.  (English standard Bible , Zechariah 10:1)

Through these observations it can be claimed that Fitzgerald is employing parallels and patterns between the weather conditions and the sentimental valence of the text to emphasize an underlying religious element. He makes positive associations between rain and emotions, taking rain as a blessing from God. In contrast, he negatively connects heat with the fate of his characters. All the aforementioned interpretations would not be detected deformation wasn’t applied to the original text. Inserting alterations to the text assisted in highlighting the connection between the text-analysis done with a computer and the manual close reading. Modifying the text arises new meaning and although the main concern not being the altered text, it sheds light on the function of the form as well as all the elements contributing to this function. The deformation applied to *the Great Gatsby* reveals the way the weather patterns function in the text and how replacing them would result in a change of direction in the trajectory of the plot. Furthermore, it informs the interpretations previously made of the content of the masked intention behind their use. Arguing with a computer removes the barrier between the reader and the text since it has the ability to logically analyze it.
